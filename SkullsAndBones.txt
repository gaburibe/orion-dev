Skulls and Bones

Mi nombre es Julia, no han inventado palabras aún para referirme al tiempo en el que nací. It's in the future but somehow long long ago, in a gallaxy far far away.

I transfered my conscious over time to visit a time where life flourished, you see, the universe also lives... and dies, and so life florishes or becomes extint, i have reasons to think i'm one of the last living things on the universe, in my time that is, so yeah... when my lover Ian died i just fell lonelly i guess, fuckin universe is super huge and rocks never managed to produce interesting thoughts.
